# Event Connect — Change Plan & Log

Running record of every change made to this project, newest phase last.
Each step lists the files touched and how it was verified.

**How changes are checked:** I don't start the dev server; you test in the browser. Before marking a step done, I:
1. Parse every changed `.jsx` file with esbuild (syntax).
2. Run ESLint with `no-undef` (catches missing imports and undefined variables).
3. Compile `index.css` with Tailwind (catches bad `@apply` classes).
4. Keep API calls, form validation and navigation logic unchanged unless the step says otherwise.

---

## Phase 1 — Documentation (done)

| Change | Files |
|---|---|
| Wrote a project README: features, tech stack, HLD/LLD Mermaid diagrams, API reference, routes, setup, known issues | `README.md` (new) |

---

## Phase 2 — Black & white "Mac app" restyle of 4 pages (done)

| Change | Files |
|---|---|
| Installed `gsap` and `@gsap/react` | `Client/package.json` |
| Glass utility classes (`.glass`, `.glass-strong`, `.glass-bar`, `.text-gradient`) | `Client/src/index.css` |
| Inter font loaded; set as Tailwind `sans` | `Client/index.html`, `Client/tailwind.config.js` |
| Header → glass bar with spring entrance | `common/Header.jsx` |
| Landing → GSAP intro timeline, mouse parallax orbs, ScrollTrigger feature cards, blur word-swap, floating sample cards | `common/LandingPage.jsx` |
| Home → pill tab toolbar (sliding `layoutId` highlight), animated panel | `common/Home.jsx` |
| Footer → glass panel (was an empty fixed div) | `common/Footer.jsx` |
| Removed desktop imitation (Dock, traffic lights, menu-bar clock) per feedback; deleted `Dock.jsx`, `hooks/use-clock.js` | — |
| Removed the Event Connect logo mark (header, footer, landing CTA) | `Header.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`, `LandingPage.jsx` |

---

## Phase 3 — Restyle all remaining pages (done)

| Change | Files |
|---|---|
| Shared form/button classes: `.field`, `.field-label`, `.field-error`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.chip` | `index.css` |
| Shared UI kit: `Page`, `PageHeader`, `EmptyState`, `Spinner`, stagger variants | `components/ui/Page.jsx` (new) |
| Shared glass `EventCard` (image, category, open/closed, dates, seats) | `components/ui/EventCard.jsx` (new) |
| `StatTile`, `InfoRow`, `Avatar` | `components/ui/Stat.jsx` (new) |
| Shared `CalendarView` (month grid, day list, portaled modal) | `components/ui/CalendarView.jsx` (new) |
| Auth pages restyled (sliding role pill, 2-col signup, spinner verify page) | `SignIn.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`, `VerifyPage.jsx` |
| Sidebar → glass rail with sliding active pill; nav logic unchanged | `common/Sidebar.jsx` |
| Content offset fixed (sidebar width matched; full width on public pages) | `RootLayout.jsx` |
| Event lists → shared card + loading/empty states | `Events.jsx`, `ClubEvents.jsx`, `EnrolledEvents.jsx`, `CreatedEvents.jsx`, `FetchEvents.jsx` |
| Gallery → shows the club's uploaded logo (was a hard-coded image) | `GalleryHomePage.jsx` |
| Event details → hero, info panels, animated FAQ/comments; now shows key takeaways, Maps link, form link, certificate. Logic lines kept verbatim | `EventsById.jsx` |
| Dashboards → profile header, stat tiles (organizer: total/ongoing/upcoming/completed) | `StudentDashBoard.jsx`, `OrganizerDashBoard.jsx` |
| Participants → Excel/PDF buttons replace the dropdown | `EventParticipants.jsx` |
| Post Event → grouped sections, animated FAQ rows, confetti portaled | `PostEvent.jsx` |
| Calendars → use `CalendarView`, monochrome status tones | `Customcalender.jsx`, `StudentCalender.jsx`, `OrganiserCalender.jsx` |
| Admin placeholders → dashboard shortcuts / "coming soon" | `AdminDashBoard.jsx`, `ManageEvents.jsx` |
| Calendar CSS → monochrome | `index.css` |

### Bug fixes in Phase 3
- **CORS error on sign in/up:** port 3000 is taken by Docker/WSL, so API calls hit a container. The Express server runs on 4000. All client URLs changed `localhost:3000` → `localhost:4000` (17 files). README updated to match.
- **`sidebarVisible is not defined`:** HMR caught `RootLayout.jsx` between two edits; the file was correct. A refresh fixes it.

Verification: all `.jsx` parse; ESLint `no-undef` clean; Tailwind compiles.

---

## Phase 4 — Dark/light themes, floating header, Aceternity UI (done — please test)

**Goal:** a dark and a light theme with a toggle, smoother Framer and GSAP animation, a rounded floating header with spacing, and Aceternity UI-style components across the app.

### Approach
- **Theming without rewriting every component:** Tailwind's `white`, `black` and `neutral-*` now resolve to CSS variables. In light mode they swap: `white` becomes ink, `black` becomes paper, and the neutral scale reverses. Existing classes theme themselves.
- The theme is stored in Recoil (persisted) and applied as `html.dark` or `html.light`. An inline script in `index.html` applies it before React loads, so there's no flash. Toggling uses the View Transitions API for a circular reveal and falls back to an instant switch.
- Aceternity-style components are built locally with Framer Motion and Tailwind (no new dependencies).

### Steps
| # | Step | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Theme tokens: CSS variables, light palette, themed glass/calendar/body, Tailwind colour mapping, keyframes (spotlight, meteor, shimmer) | `tailwind.config.js`, `index.css` | done |
| 4.2 | Theme state (`themeAtom`, persisted) + `useTheme` hook + `ThemeToggle` (sun/moon swap, circular reveal via View Transitions); inline no-flash script | `components/theme/useTheme.js` (new), `components/theme/ThemeToggle.jsx` (new), `index.html` | done |
| 4.3 | Aceternity components (Framer Motion + Tailwind, no new deps): `Spotlight`, `FlipWords`, `TextGenerateEffect`, `MovingBorderButton`, `HoverGrid` (card hover effect), `TiltCard` (3D card + sheen), `BentoGrid`/`BentoGridItem`, `Meteors`, `BackgroundGradient`, `InfiniteMovingCards` (GSAP marquee, slows on hover), `DotBackground` | `components/ui/aceternity/*` (11 new files) | done |
| 4.4 | Header → floating rounded pill (`top-4`, side gaps, `rounded-full`), hides on scroll down and returns on scroll up, shadow once scrolled, theme toggle, mobile sidebar toggle moved here | `Header.jsx` | done |
| 4.5 | Sidebar → floating rounded panel (`left-4 top-24 bottom-4`); content offset `md:ml-64` / `md:ml-24`; `main` gets `pt-24` to clear the header; global `DotBackground`; toasts follow theme; Home toolbar sticks at `top-24`, duplicate orbs removed | `Sidebar.jsx`, `RootLayout.jsx`, `Home.jsx` | done |
| 4.6 | Applied Aceternity components (see "Where each component is used") | Landing, auth, lists, gallery, `EventCard`, `Page.jsx` | done |
| 4.7 | Theme-proofed hard-coded colours: calendar event tones use CSS vars; map invert only in dark (`dark:` filter); grid lines/dots use `--c-white`; confetti has dark + light pieces; club logo tile pinned to real white | `CalendarView.jsx`, `EventsById.jsx`, `LandingPage.jsx`, `PostEvent.jsx`, `GalleryHomePage.jsx` | done |
| 4.8 | App-wide `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` | `main.jsx` | done |
| 4.9 | Verification pass | — | done |

### Where each component is used
| Component | Used in |
|---|---|
| Spotlight, FlipWords, TextGenerateEffect, MovingBorderButton | Landing hero |
| TiltCard | Landing sample cards, every `EventCard`, Gallery club cards |
| InfiniteMovingCards (GSAP) | Landing — event types marquee (descriptive copy, not testimonials) |
| BentoGrid | Landing features |
| BackgroundGradient + Meteors | Landing CTA, Sign In, Sign Up cards |
| Meteors | `EmptyState` (all lists) |
| HoverGrid | Events, Club Events, Enrolled, Created, Fetch Events, Gallery |
| TextGenerateEffect | Every `PageHeader` subtitle |
| DotBackground | Whole app (`RootLayout`) |

### Content changes requested during this phase
- Landing hero paragraph shortened to two lines: "Hackathons, workshops, fests and meetups — all in one place." / "Discover, enroll and earn rewards."

### Verification (4.9)
- esbuild: every `.js`/`.jsx` in `src` parses ✅
- ESLint `no-undef`: no undefined identifiers ✅
- Tailwind compile ✅. Checked the output: `.text-white` → `rgb(var(--c-white) / …)`, `.bg-white/10` → `rgb(var(--c-white) / 0.1)`, `html.light` palette present, `animate-spotlight` / `animate-meteor` keyframes generated, map filter scoped to `.dark` ✅
- Not run: the dev server and the browser (you test these).

### What to check in the browser
1. Toggle the theme from the header: there's a circular reveal (Chrome/Edge; other browsers switch instantly). Reload: the theme sticks with no flash.
2. Scroll down any page: the header slides away. Scroll up: it returns.
3. On a phone: the sidebar button is in the header and the sidebar floats in from the left.
4. Light mode: text, glass cards, calendar, map and toasts are all readable.

### Fix 4.10 — "UI is broken in the landing page" (awaiting screenshot to confirm)
Found by reading the code (no browser here):
| Problem | Cause | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| A huge blurred light shape across the whole landing page | `Spotlight` was absolutely positioned in the full-page container, so `h-[169%] w-[138%]` was relative to thousands of pixels | Moved it into the hero inside a clipped `-z-10` wrapper, sized to the hero only | `LandingPage.jsx` |
| Headline jumps / "Find" snaps sideways on every word change | `FlipWords` used `mode="wait"` while the exiting word is `position:absolute`, leaving a frame with no word in the layout | Removed `mode="wait"` (Aceternity's behaviour); made the `h1` `relative` so the exiting word stays in place | `FlipWords.jsx`, `LandingPage.jsx` |

Verified: both files parse; ESLint `no-undef` clean.

---

## Phase 5 — Remove Aceternity, back to clean & simple (done — please test)

**Request:** keep the dark/light theme, smooth Framer + GSAP motion, and the rounded header with spacing. Remove the Aceternity components and extra animations. Go back to the clean Phase 3 design, responsive.

| # | Step | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Landing → Phase 3 layout (GSAP intro + scroll reveals, blur word-swap, glass feature cards, glass CTA). Two-line hero copy kept; colours theme-aware. Removed: Spotlight, FlipWords, TextGenerate, MovingBorder, Tilt, marquee, Bento, Meteors/BackgroundGradient, mouse parallax, orb drift, card float loop | `LandingPage.jsx` | done |
| 5.2 | Lists → plain staggered grid (no HoverGrid); `EventCard` → simple hover lift (no tilt) | `Events`, `ClubEvents`, `EnrolledEvents`, `CreatedEvents`, `FetchEvents`, `ui/EventCard.jsx` | done |
| 5.3 | Gallery → plain staggered grid with hover lift | `GalleryHomePage.jsx` | done |
| 5.4 | Sign In / Sign Up → plain glass card (no gradient border/meteors) | `SignIn.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx` | done |
| 5.5 | `PageHeader` → simple fade (no word-by-word); `EmptyState` → no meteors | `ui/Page.jsx` | done |
| 5.6 | Header → stays visible (no hide-on-scroll); keeps the rounded floating pill, spacing, theme toggle, shadow when scrolled | `Header.jsx` | done |
| 5.7 | Remove the dot background; delete `components/ui/aceternity/`; drop spotlight/meteor/shimmer keyframes | `RootLayout.jsx`, `tailwind.config.js` | done |
| 5.8 | Verification pass | — | done |

### Verification (5.8)
- No remaining references to Aceternity components (grep) ✅; `components/ui/aceternity/` deleted (11 files)
- esbuild: every `.js`/`.jsx` parses ✅
- ESLint `no-undef`: clean ✅
- Tailwind compiles ✅
- `vite build` (to a temp folder, not the project): 7272 modules, built OK ✅
- Not run: the dev server / browser (you test)

### What is kept from Phase 4
- Dark/light theme (CSS variables, sun/moon toggle with circular reveal, saved choice, no flash)
- Rounded floating header with spacing (`top-4`, side gaps, `rounded-full`), now always visible
- Floating rounded sidebar and layout spacing
- `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`; calendar/map/confetti theme fixes

### Animation inventory after cleanup
- Framer: header fade-in, page fade-up, staggered card grids, gentle hover lift (-4px), tab/sidebar sliding pill, hero word swap, modal/FAQ/comment transitions, theme icon swap
- GSAP: landing intro (hero copy → sample cards), one-time scroll fade-ups (features, CTA), Home intro
- Removed: mouse parallax, orb drift, card float loop, header hide-on-scroll, 3D tilt, marquee, meteors, spotlight, moving border

---

## Phase 6 — Calendar UI + unreadable calendar text (done — please test)

**Problem:** calendar text blends into the background, and toolbar buttons are hard to read, depending on the theme.
**Root cause:** `react-big-calendar.css` is imported by `CalendarView` *after* `index.css`. Its rules have the same specificity as ours, so the later file wins and brings back hard-coded colours: `#e6e6e6` off-range cells, `#eaf6ff` today, `#373a3c` toolbar buttons, a white "+N more" popup, `#999` off-range dates.

| # | Step | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Scope all calendar styles under `.ec-calendar` (higher specificity, so they always win), fully theme-aware; style the today badge, selected day, "+N more" link and popup | `index.css` | done |
| 6.2 | Custom toolbar (month title, Today, prev/next) replaces the library's buttons | `ui/CalendarView.jsx` | done |
| 6.3 | Day panel: opens on today by default, lists events that *span* the selected day (was start-day only), shows a count; selected day highlighted in the grid | `ui/CalendarView.jsx` | done |
| 6.4 | Verification pass | — | done |

### Verification (6.4)
- Built CSS checked: every library colour rule that affects the month view (`#e6e6e6`, `#eaf6ff`, `#999`, `#ddd` borders, `#fff` overlay, `#3174ad`/`#265985` "+N more", toolbar `#373a3c`) is overridden by a higher-specificity `.ec-calendar …` rule, or no longer rendered (custom toolbar) ✅
- esbuild parse, ESLint `no-undef`, Tailwind compile, `vite build` ✅
- Removed the now-unused `emptyHint` prop from `Customcalender.jsx` and `StudentCalender.jsx`

## Phase 7 — macOS Dock–style tab bar on Home (done — please test)

**Request:** a macOS taskbar (Dock) animation for the Home tabs (Events, Enrolled, My Calendar, Calendar, Gallery, …), centered, using Framer + GSAP.

| # | Step | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | `Dock` component. Framer: cursor-proximity magnification (spring), tooltip label, active dot, sliding active state. GSAP: launch bounce on click, staggered rise-in on mount. Touch screens: no magnification, small labels under the icons | `ui/Dock.jsx` (new) | done |
| 7.2 | Home: replace the pill toolbar with the centered Dock (sticky under the header); tab logic unchanged | `common/Home.jsx` | done |
| 7.3 | Verification pass | — | done |

### Icon refresh (requested mid-phase)
Home tab icons switched from Tabler to cleaner **lucide-react** icons (already a dependency), shown in rounded app-style tiles:
| Tab | Icon |
|---|---|
| Events | `Compass` |
| Enrolled | `Ticket` |
| My Calendar | `CalendarHeart` |
| Post Event | `SquarePlus` |
| Created | `FolderKanban` |
| Calendar | `CalendarDays` |
| Gallery | `Images` |
| Dashboard | `LayoutDashboard` |

### How the Dock behaves
- **Desktop (mouse, ≥768px):** tiles grow as the cursor approaches (46px → 66px, Framer spring); the label appears as a tooltip; the active tile is solid with a dot underneath. Clicking plays a GSAP launch bounce. The Dock is centered and sticks under the header.
- **Phones/touch:** no magnification; each tile shows a small caption; the bar scrolls sideways if needed.
- **On load:** tiles drop in one after another (GSAP, `back.out`).
- Reduced-motion users get no bounce or rise-in.

### Verification (7.3)
- esbuild parse, ESLint `no-undef`, `vite build` ✅
- Not run: the dev server / browser (you test)

---

## Phase 8 — Clean up the Home Dock animation (done — please test)

**Feedback:** the animation on the top bar of the dashboard (Home) page isn't good; make it clean.

| Problem (from code review) | Fix |
|---|---|
| Magnification changed each tile's width/height, so the centered bar resized and slid sideways as the mouse moved | Magnify with `scale` only (1 → 1.18). The layout never moves and tiles stay inside the bar |
| Two entrance animations on the same bar (Dock's own GSAP drop-in + Home's GSAP intro) | Removed the Dock's drop-in; Home's single fade-up remains |
| Magnified tiles spilled outside the glass bar; the bounce moved downward | Tiles scale within the bar padding; the click is a subtle GSAP press (0.92 → 1) |
| Labels only in hover tooltips; per-tile dots faded in/out | Labels always under the icons; one active indicator that slides between tabs (Framer `layoutId`) |

| # | Step | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Rewrite Dock animation as above | `ui/Dock.jsx` | done |
| 8.2 | Verification pass | — | done |

### Verification (8.2)
- esbuild parse, ESLint `no-undef`, `vite build` ✅
- Not run: the dev server / browser (you test)

### Follow-up 8.3 — "add some extra width and make animation more smoother" (done)
| Setting | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Tile slot width | 60px / 68px (sm) | 68px / 84px (sm) |
| Tile size / icon | 44px / 20px | 48px / 22px |
| Bar padding / gap / radius | px-2–3, gap 1–1.5, 22px | px-3–5, gap 1.5–2, 26px |
| Magnify spring | stiffness 260, damping 22, mass 0.4 | stiffness 150, damping 24, mass 0.6 (no overshoot) |
| Magnify reach / peak | 120px / 1.18× | 170px / 1.16× (gentler falloff) |
| Active indicator spring | 420 / 34 | 260 / 30, mass 0.8; width 20→24px |
| Click press (GSAP) | 0.92→1, back.out(3), 0.45s | 0.94→1, power3.out, 0.6s |
| Colour transitions | 300ms | 500ms ease-out |

Verified: esbuild parse, ESLint `no-undef`, Tailwind compile ✅

---

## Phase 9 — README update (done)

Brought `README.md` in line with Phases 2–8:
| Section | Change |
|---|---|
| Intro | Describes the B&W glass UI, dark/light themes, floating header, Dock, Framer + GSAP; links `plan.md` |
| Table of contents | Added **UI & Design System**; renumbered |
| Features | Calendars (opens on today, multi-day day panel), Home Dock (student & organizer), admin dashboard shortcuts; UI/UX list rewritten |
| Tech stack | Added an Animation row (Framer Motion, GSAP + `@gsap/react`) and an Icons row (lucide for the Dock, Tabler elsewhere); noted that moment comes with react-big-calendar |
| **New: UI & Design System** | Look and feel, theming explanation + Mermaid diagram + file table, layout, animation inventory, shared `ui/` components |
| Project structure | Added `theme/`, `ui/` (Page, EventCard, Stat, CalendarView, Dock), `index.css`, `index.html`, `plan.md` |
| HLD / component tree | `themeAtom` in the store; `MotionConfig`, ThemeToggle, Home Dock tabs, CalendarView, admin pages |
| Known issues | `bcrypt` explained accurately (it resolves only from `~/node_modules` on this machine); port 3000 / misleading CORS note; admin UI status; View Transitions note |
| Future improvements | Admin item reworded |

Checked: all table-of-contents links resolve to headings (fixed a pre-existing broken "Auth & Verification State Machine" link); 14 Mermaid blocks intact.

### Notes / limitations
- The circular theme reveal needs the View Transitions API (Chromium). Elsewhere it falls back to an instant switch.
- Dock magnification turns off on touch screens and below 768px; reduced-motion users get no press animation.

## Phase 10 — Fix errors from the merge commit `178175d` (done — please test)

**Problem:** the merge `178175d` ("Merge branch 'main' into main") resolved conflicts by taking the older branch in some files. It broke the build and undid parts of Phases 2–5.

| # | Error | Cause | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | Build fails: `Unexpected closing "Page" tag does not match opening "div" tag` | Merge kept the old `<div className="… bg-black">` opener but the new `</Page>` closer | Restored the Phase 3/5 `Page` + `PageHeader` + `Spinner` + `EmptyState` block | `common/Events.jsx` |
| 10.2 | Runtime crash: `useRecoilValue` / `userAtom` is not defined | Merge replaced the imports with the old footer's imports but kept the new body | Restored the Phase 2 glass footer | `common/Footer.jsx` |
| 10.3 | Header lost the floating rounded pill, theme toggle, mobile sidebar button | Merge took the pre-Phase 2 header | Restored the Phase 5 header | `common/Header.jsx` |
| 10.4 | Content hidden under the floating header; sidebar offset wrong (`md:ml-16`, `pt-14`) | Merge took the old layout | Restored the Phase 4/5 layout (`md:ml-64` / `md:ml-24`, `pt-24`) | `RootLayout.jsx` |
| 10.5 | Admin sign-in 404 | Client called `/auth/admin/signin`; the server mounts admin at `/admin` (`server.js:30`) | Changed back to `/admin/signin` | `common/SignIn.jsx` |
| 10.6 | All API calls go to `undefined/...` locally | The merge switched URLs to `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`, but there was no `Client/.env` | Added `Client/.env` with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000` (gitignored; set the same variable in Vercel for production) | `Client/.env` (new) |

**Kept from the merge:** every API URL now uses `VITE_API_URL` (production-ready).
**Not used:** `routes.jsx` and `LandingPageLayout.jsx` (new from the merge). `main.jsx` defines the routes itself and never imports them. Left untouched.

### Verification (10.7)
- esbuild: every `.js`/`.jsx` in `src` parses ✅ (`Events.jsx` failed before the fix)
- ESLint `no-undef` with the project config: clean ✅. The probe on the merged `Footer.jsx` reports the 2 errors, so the check works. Note: ESLint without the project config skips `.jsx` files and reports nothing.
- `vite build` to a temp folder: built OK ✅
- Not run: the dev server / browser (you test). Restart `npm run dev` so Vite picks up the new `.env`.

---

## Phase 11 — README rewritten as a knowledge-transfer guide (done)

**Request:** a README with features, workflows, LLD, HLD, sequence flows, setup, and everything a student needs as knowledge transfer.
**Found:** the merge `178175d` had also replaced the 996-line README (Phases 1 and 9) with a short one. The full version was restored from `80ae69d` and extended.

| Change | Details |
|---|---|
| Restored | Features, tech stack, UI & design system, project structure, HLD, LLD (ER, class, component tree, sequence diagrams, state machines), API reference, routes, validation |
| New, Part A (knowledge transfer) | Start Here (1-minute overview, mental model, 5 key facts), Glossary, Getting Started (with first-run checklist), Environment Variables (with examples), User Workflows (student/organizer/admin flowcharts, Home tabs by role), How a Request Flows Through the Code (enroll walkthrough, file by file) |
| New sequence diagrams | 7. page refresh & logout (client session), 8. theme toggle |
| New, Part C (working on the project) | How to Add a Feature (API endpoint, page, styling rules), Development Workflow & Checks (git, merge-conflict lesson, lint/build), Deployment (Vercel + Node host + Atlas), Troubleshooting table, Learning Path (day-by-day reading order + starter tasks), Credits |
| Corrected to match the code | `PORT` (uppercase) is shared by the API and the mailers; `Boolean("false")` makes `SECURE` always true; `validEventData` isn't attached to the create route; enrollment doesn't check seats; sign-in navigates by **username**; admin route has no index page; only `Auth.js` uses `bcrypt` (`Admin.js` uses `bcryptjs`); `routes.jsx` + `LandingPageLayout.jsx` unused; client needs `VITE_API_URL` |

Verified: every internal `#anchor` link resolves to a heading; 19 Mermaid blocks. Note: the existing `npx eslint src` reports 37 errors in existing code (mostly unused variables). The README tells contributors not to add new ones.

---

## Phase 12 — Club gallery: missing logos + backup image (done — please test)

**Problem:** club logos are missing in the gallery.
**Cause:** the fallback was used only when `logo` was empty. A saved URL that fails to load (deleted Cloudinary asset, failed upload, blocked host) showed a broken image. The fallback itself was hot-linked from `turinghut.org` (another club's real logo, can be blocked by hot-link protection).

| # | Step | Files |
|---|---|---|
| 12.1 | Local backup image: neutral monochrome "club building" tile, matches the B&W design | `Client/public/club-placeholder.svg` (new) |
| 12.2 | `getLogoSrc()` trims the URL and falls back when empty; `onError` swaps to the backup once (no loop if the backup fails); `loading="lazy"`; alt text "<club> logo" | `common/GalleryHomePage.jsx` |

Verified: esbuild parse ✅. ESLint on the file shows only the existing `motion` false positive (JSX member usage).
Note: `Client/.env` currently has only `VITE_API_URL`. Organizer signup uploads the logo with `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` and `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`. Without them the upload fails, so new clubs can't register with a logo.

---

## Phase 13 — Registration (verification) emails (done — please test)

**Problem:** registration emails don't arrive reliably.

| # | Cause (from code review) | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13.1 | Sender login read `process.env.USER`. `dotenv` never overrides existing variables, and Git Bash / macOS / Linux / most hosts already set `USER` to the login name, so Gmail got the wrong username | New shared mailer reads `USER`/`PASS` straight from `Server/.env` (or `MAIL_USER`/`MAIL_PASS`), and only accepts a value that looks like an email | `utils/mailer.js` (new) |
| 13.2 | SMTP port was `Number(process.env.PORT)`: the API's port, `NaN` locally | Own `MAIL_PORT`, default `465` | `utils/mailer.js` |
| 13.3 | `secure: Boolean(process.env.SECURE)` → `Boolean("false")` is `true` | `MAIL_SECURE` parsed as text; default from port (465 → TLS) | `utils/mailer.js` |
| 13.4 | App Password copied with spaces | Spaces removed | `utils/mailer.js` |
| 13.5 | Send errors were swallowed, so signup always said "email sent" | `sendVerificationEmail` throws; signup returns `emailSent` and an honest message | `utils/mailer.js`, `apis/Auth.js` |
| 13.6 | Unverified sign-in re-sent only when no token existed, so after a failed send nothing was re-sent for 1h | Every unverified sign-in re-sends (reuses the unexpired token); responds 403 `{ message, needsVerification, emailSent }` | `apis/Auth.js` |
| 13.7 | No way to see a bad Gmail login until someone signs up | `verifyMailer()` runs at startup: prints `Mailer ready: …` or `Mailer NOT ready — …` with an App Password hint | `utils/mailer.js`, `server.js` |
| 13.8 | Plain-text email with a bare link | HTML email with a "Verify email" button + plain-text fallback, subject "Verify your Event Connect email" | `utils/mailer.js` |
| 13.9 | Trailing slash in `BASE_URL` gave `//verifyPage` | Trailing slashes stripped; default `http://localhost:5173` | `apis/Auth.js` |
| 13.10 | Duplicate email/username/phone → 500 "Something went wrong" | 409 "An account with this email already exists" | `apis/Auth.js` |
| 13.11 | Zod errors were a generic "Invalid data" (organizer used Zod 3's `.errors`, undefined in Zod 4) | First issue in the message, e.g. "Invalid password: …" | `apis/Auth.js` |
| 13.12 | Client always showed "Something went wrong" / "Invalid credentials" | SignUp shows the server message (and a Cloudinary hint), then goes to Sign In; SignIn shows "verify your email" as an info toast | `SignUp.jsx`, `SignIn.jsx` |
| 13.13 | Signup response included the user document (with password hash) | Removed from the response (the client didn't use it) | `apis/Auth.js` |

`sendUserEmail.js` / `sendOrganiserEmail.js` stay as thin wrappers, so existing imports still work. README env table, structure, class diagram, troubleshooting and known issues updated.

Verified: `node --check` on all changed server files ✅; esbuild parse of SignIn/SignUp ✅; ESLint `no-undef` clean ✅. Not run: the server, real email sending (you test).

### How to test
1. Restart the server. The console must show **`Mailer ready: <your gmail> via smtp.gmail.com:465`**. If it shows `Mailer NOT ready`, the reason follows (usually `PASS` isn't an App Password).
2. Sign up a new student → message "We sent a verification link to …" → you land on Sign In → email arrives (check spam) → click → "verified" → sign in.
3. Sign in with an unverified account → info toast "Please verify your email first. We sent a new link…" and a new email.
4. Sign up again with the same email → "An account with this email already exists".

## Phase 14 — Fix the errors in the project (done — please test)

### Lint: 37 errors → 0
| # | Problem | Fix | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14.1 | 29 false "unused" errors: `motion` (used as `<motion.div>`) and `Icon` (used as `<Icon/>`). The config has no React plugin, so ESLint couldn't see JSX usage | Small local rule `local/jsx-uses-vars` in the config (same job as `eslint-plugin-react/jsx-uses-vars`, no new dependency) | `Client/eslint.config.js` |
| 14.2 | Dead `handleFormSubmit` (a leftover copy of PostEvent's create) | Removed | `common/EventsById.jsx` |
| 14.3 | `commentEdit` state set but never read; unused `useLocation` | Removed | `common/EventsById.jsx` |
| 14.4 | Caught errors discarded (`catch(e)` unused) | `console.error(e)` before the alert | `EventsById.jsx`, `organizer/FetchEvents.jsx` |
| 14.5 | Unused `user` / `userAtom` / `useRecoilValue` | Removed | `organizer/PostEvent.jsx` |
| 14.6 | Unused `createRoutesFromElements` import | Removed | `main.jsx` |
| 14.7 | `useEffect` missing `clubById` dependency: opening another club kept the old club's events | `[clubById]` | `common/ClubEvents.jsx` |

Remaining: 5 `react-refresh/only-export-components` warnings (dev hot-reload hints for files that export helpers next to components). Harmless; left as is.

### Runtime errors
| # | Problem | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14.8 | Server crashed on a fresh clone: `Auth.js` required `bcrypt`, which isn't in `package.json` (worked here only via `~/node_modules`) | `require('bcryptjs')`, the declared dependency. It verifies existing `$2b$` hashes, so current accounts still sign in | `Server/apis/Auth.js` |
| 14.9 | `validPerson` / `validAdmin` never responded when the user wasn't an organizer/admin, so the request hung | Return 403 with a message | `Server/apis/Event.js`, `Server/apis/Admin.js` |
| 14.10 | Admin sign-in landed on `/admin-profile/<username>`, which had no index route, so the content area was empty | Index route → `AdminDashBoard` | `Client/src/main.jsx` |
| 14.11 | `GET /event/students/enroll/:eventId` was public: anyone could list enrolled students | Now `verifyUser, validPerson` (organizers only). The participants page already sends the token | `Server/apis/Event.js` |

README updated (lint status, API table, routes, known issues, troubleshooting, starter tasks).

### Verification (14.12)
- ESLint (project config): **0 errors**, 5 warnings ✅
- `vite build` to a temp folder: 8913 modules, built OK ✅
- `node --check` on every server file ✅; `bcryptjs` hash + compare round-trip ✅
- Not run: the dev server / browser (you test): sign in as student, organizer and admin; open Participants; open two different clubs from the Gallery.

## Phase 15 — 500 on `/auth/student/signUp` (deployed, Render) (done — needs a redeploy)

**Report:** `event-connect-backend-slbb.onrender.com/auth/student/signUp` → 500.

**Findings (probes that save nothing):**
- `GET /organiser/get/organiserDetails` → 200 in 0.6s, so the server and MongoDB are up.
- `POST /auth/student/signUp` with `{"username":"x"}` → `{"message":"Invalid data"}`. That's the **old** code (the current code answers `Invalid username: …`). **Render has not deployed** the Phase 13/14 commits, even though both GitHub repos (`Vinaykumarp2005/Event-Connect` and `Cleancode16/Event-Connect`) have them.
- The old code returns 500 for a duplicate email/username/phone and logs into Gmail with the wrong `USER`.

| # | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|
| 15.1 | Removed `const { useState } = require('react')` (accidental auto-import from an old commit). `react` isn't a server dependency, so a clean install (Render) can crash with `Cannot find module 'react'`. Locally it only worked because React sits in a parent folder | `Server/apis/Event.js` |
| 15.2 | Checked that every server module loads using only `Server/node_modules` (the same as a clean Render install) ✅ | — |
| 15.3 | Render's free plan blocks outgoing SMTP ports, so Gmail SMTP can't send from there. Added optional **Brevo** HTTPS API: set `BREVO_API_KEY` (+ `MAIL_FROM`, a sender verified in Brevo). Without it, Gmail SMTP is used as before. The startup log says which one is active, with a hint on timeouts | `Server/utils/mailer.js` |
| 15.4 | `"engines": { "node": ">=18" }` (Brevo uses the built-in `fetch`) | `Server/package.json` |
| 15.5 | README: env vars, Render deployment, "is the new code live?" check, troubleshooting rows | `README.md` |

Verified: `node --check` ✅, all server modules load with only `Server/node_modules` ✅. Not run: real email sending.

### What you need to do
1. Commit and push (both repos, if Render watches `Vinaykumarp2005/Event-Connect`).
2. Render → the backend service → **Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit**. If the build fails, the log shows why. Check that auto-deploy watches the right repo and branch (`main`).
3. Render → Environment: `DB_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `USER`, `PASS`, `BASE_URL` (the Vercel client URL). For email on the free plan: create a free Brevo account → verify your Gmail as a sender → SMTP & API → API keys → set `BREVO_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM`.
4. Check: Render logs show `Mailer ready: …`, and the probe in README → Deployment answers `Invalid username: …`.

### 15.6 — Browser `[DOM] … autocomplete` warnings
Added `autoComplete` to the auth inputs: Sign In `email` / `current-password`; Sign Up `username` / `email` / `tel` / `new-password`. Removes the Chrome console warnings and lets password managers fill and save correctly. Files: `SignIn.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`. Verified: esbuild parse ✅, ESLint clean ✅.
