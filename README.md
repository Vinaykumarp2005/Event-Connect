# Event Connect

A full-stack **campus event management platform**. Students discover and enroll in events, organizers (clubs) publish and manage events and their participants, and admins moderate content and approve events.

Built with **React + Vite** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express + MongoDB** on the backend, with JWT authentication, email verification over Gmail SMTP, and image uploads to Cloudinary.

The interface is a clean **black & white glass design** with **dark and light themes**, a floating rounded header, a macOS Dock–style tab bar on the home screen, and smooth, restrained animation built with **Framer Motion** and **GSAP**. It is responsive from phones to wide desktops.

> Every change to the project is logged step by step in [`plan.md`](plan.md). Interview-style questions about the project are in [`prep.txt`](prep.txt).

## Start Here

### What the app does, in one minute
- **Students** sign up, verify their email, browse campus events, enroll, earn reward points, comment, and see their events on a calendar.
- **Organizers** (clubs) sign up with a club logo, post events with images and a sample certificate, edit or delete them, and export participant lists to Excel or PDF.
- **Admins** can approve events and delete any comment. Today this is API-only; the admin UI is a set of shortcut cards.

### The mental model
```
Browser (React SPA, Vite, port 5173)
   │  axios → `${VITE_API_URL}/...`   header  Authorization: <JWT>
   ▼
Express API (Node, port 4000) ── routers: /auth /event /student /organiser /admin
   │  Mongoose
   ▼
MongoDB (Students, Organizers, Admins, Events, verification tokens)

Side services: Cloudinary (the browser uploads images directly) · Gmail SMTP (verification emails)
```

### Five facts that save hours
1. **Two apps, two terminals.** `Server/` (Express, `npm start`) and `Client/` (React, `npm run dev`). Each has its own `package.json`, `node_modules` and `.env`.
2. **The client finds the API through `VITE_API_URL`** in `Client/.env`. If it's missing, every request goes to `undefined/...` and fails. Restart Vite after editing `.env`.
3. **The JWT is sent raw** in the `Authorization` header (no `Bearer ` prefix). It's stored in `localStorage.token`. The logged-in user lives in the Recoil `userAtom`, which is also saved to `localStorage`.
4. **Routes are defined in `Client/src/main.jsx`.** `routes.jsx` and `LandingPageLayout.jsx` exist but aren't used.
5. **The URL param named `:emailId` actually holds the username.** Sign-in navigates to `/{role}-profile/<username>`.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning in this codebase |
|---|---|
| **Organizer / Organiser** | Both spellings are used. A club account that posts events. API prefix `/organiser`, model `Organizer`, route `/organizer-profile/...` |
| **Calender** | Misspelling used in file and route names (`Customcalender.jsx`, `/studentCalender`). Keep it when you link to these files and routes |
| **`userAtom`** | Recoil atom with `{ username, email, role, _id, isLoggedIn }`, persisted to `localStorage` |
| **`verifyUser`** | Express middleware. Reads the JWT from `Authorization`, sets `req.userId`, or returns 401 |
| **`validPerson` / `validAdmin`** | Role guards. They check that `req.userId` exists in the `Organizer` / `Admin` collection |
| **Verification token** | 32-byte hex string in `StudentToken` / `OrganizerToken`. Deleted by MongoDB after 1 hour (TTL index) |
| **Unsigned upload preset** | Cloudinary setting that lets the browser upload without a server-side signature |
| **Glass** | The translucent, blurred surface style (`.glass`, `.glass-strong`, `.glass-bar` in `index.css`) |
| **Dock** | The macOS-style tab bar on the Home page (`components/ui/Dock.jsx`) |
| **`plan.md`** | Log of every change, by phase. Read it to learn why things are the way they are |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **MongoDB**: local, or a free MongoDB Atlas cluster
- **Gmail account with an App Password** (Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords). Your normal password won't work for SMTP.
- **Cloudinary account** with an **unsigned upload preset** (Settings → Upload → Upload presets → Add → Signing mode: Unsigned)

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinaykumarp2005/Event-Connect.git
cd Event-Connect
```

### 2. Backend (terminal 1)
```bash
cd Server
npm install
# create Server/.env (see Environment Variables)
npm start              # node server.js → "server is running ... on port 4000"
```
You should also see `database is successfully connected to the backend`. If you don't, check `DB_URL`.

### 3. Frontend (terminal 2)
```bash
cd Client
npm install
# create Client/.env (see Environment Variables)
npm run dev            # → http://localhost:5173
```
Other scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run preview`, `npm run lint`.

### 4. First run checklist
1. Open `http://localhost:5173` → the landing page loads.
2. **Sign up** as a student. Check the inbox of that email for the verification link and click it. It opens `/verifyPage/student/<id>/<token>` and redirects to Sign In.
3. **Sign in**. You land on `/student-profile/<username>` (Home with the Dock).
4. Sign up as an **organizer** in another browser profile, verify, and post an event. It shows up in the student's Events tab.

### 5. Create an admin (no UI for this)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/admin/signUp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"admin","email":"admin@example.com","password":"admin@1234"}'
```
Then sign in on `/signin` with the role set to Admin.

---

## Environment Variables

> Never commit `.env` files. Both `Server/.gitignore` and `Client/.gitignore` already ignore them. Share values privately.

### `Server/.env`

| Key | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_URL` | `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster/eventconnect` | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | any long random string | Secret used to sign JWTs |
| `PORT` | *(leave unset locally)* | API port (default `4000`). Hosting platforms set it automatically. Not used for email |
| `USER` | `you@gmail.com` | Gmail address that sends the emails. On hosts where `USER` is already the system login name, set `MAIL_USER` instead |
| `PASS` | 16-char App Password | Gmail **App Password** (spaces are removed automatically). Your normal Gmail password won't work. `MAIL_PASS` also works |
| `HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` | SMTP host (default `smtp.gmail.com`). `MAIL_HOST` also works |
| `MAIL_PORT` | `465` | Optional. SMTP port (default `465`) |
| `MAIL_SECURE` | `true` | Optional. `true` for port 465, `false` for 587. Defaults from the port |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | `xkeysib-…` | Optional. Sends email through the Brevo HTTPS API instead of Gmail SMTP. **Needed on Render's free plan**, which blocks SMTP ports |
| `MAIL_FROM` | `you@gmail.com` | Sender address for Brevo (must be verified in Brevo → Senders). Defaults to `USER` |
| `SERVICE`, `SECURE` | | No longer read (replaced by `MAIL_PORT` / `MAIL_SECURE`). Safe to leave in the file |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | Frontend origin used inside verification links |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` / `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` / `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | | Reserved for server-side uploads (currently unused) |

### `Client/.env`

| Key | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `http://localhost:4000` | Base URL of the Express API. No trailing slash |
| `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | your cloud name | Used by SignUp (logo) and PostEvent/EventsById (images) |
| `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` | your unsigned preset | Same as above |

Vite reads `.env` only at startup, so **restart `npm run dev`** after changing it. Only variables starting with `VITE_` reach the browser.

## How a Request Flows Through the Code

Example: **a student enrolls in an event.** Follow the files in this order and you'll understand the whole stack.

| Step | Where | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Client/src/main.jsx` | Route `student-profile/:emailId/viewevent/:eventById` renders `EventsById` inside `RootLayout` |
| 2 | `Client/src/components/common/EventsById.jsx` | On mount: `GET ${VITE_API_URL}/event/app/v1/events/:eventId` with `Authorization: localStorage.token` |
| 3 | `Server/server.js` | `app.use('/event', eventApp)` passes the request to the event router |
| 4 | `Server/middlewares/verifyUser.js` | `jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET)` → `req.userId`. Invalid → 401 |
| 5 | `Server/apis/Event.js` | Handler loads the event and returns it with `isEnrolled` for this user |
| 6 | `EventsById.jsx` | User clicks **Enroll** → `PUT /event/app/v1/update/student/:eventId` with `{ enroll: true, name, rewardPoints }` |
| 7 | `Server/apis/Event.js` | Blocks duplicates, pushes into `event.enrolledStudents`, `enrolled += 1`; pushes into `student.eventsEnrolled`, adds `rewardsEarned` |
| 8 | `Server/models/event.model.js`, `student.model.js` | Mongoose schemas that define those fields |
| 9 | `EventsById.jsx` | Updates the enrolled state and the "spots filled" bar. Errors show the server's `message` |

Every other feature follows the same pattern: **page component → axios call → router in `Server/apis/` → `verifyUser` → (role guard) → Mongoose model → JSON back → update state**.

---

## Features

### Authentication and security
- **Three roles**: Student, Organizer, Admin, each with its own signup/signin flow.
- **Email verification**: on signup, a random 32-byte token is stored and a verification link is emailed via Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP). The token expires automatically after **1 hour** (MongoDB TTL index).
- **Re-send on login**: if an unverified user tries to sign in, a fresh verification email is sent and login is blocked.
- **Password hashing** with bcryptjs.
- **JWT auth**: the token is sent in the `Authorization` header. Organizer tokens expire after 1 hour.
- **Role-based access control**: `verifyUser` middleware decodes the JWT, then route-level guards (`validPerson`, `validAdmin`) check that the user id belongs to the right collection.
- **Request validation** with Zod schemas (signup, signin). An event schema (`validEventData`) is also defined in `Event.js` but isn't attached to the create route yet.
- **Persisted session**: user state lives in a Recoil atom persisted to `localStorage` (`recoil-persist`), so login survives page refresh.

### Student features
- Browse all events in a card grid (name, category, image, dates).
- View full event details: description, venue and map link, fee, FAQs, key takeaways, sample certificate, reward points, and seats left.
- **Enroll in events**. Duplicate enrollments are blocked, and the event's `enrolled` counter is incremented.
- **Earn reward points** on every enrollment (added to `rewardsEarned`).
- **Comments**: add, edit, and delete your own comments on an event.
- **Enrolled events** page.
- **Personal calendar** of enrolled events, and a **global events calendar** of all events. Both open on today and have a side panel listing every event running on the selected day, including multi-day events, with a details pop-up.
- **Home screen** with a centered macOS Dock–style tab bar to switch between Events, Enrolled, My Calendar, Calendar, Gallery and Dashboard.
- **Club gallery**: browse every organizer/club by logo and open a club page listing its events.
- **Dashboard**: view and edit your profile (username, phone, department, year), and see reward points.

### Organizer (club) features
- Signup with club name, position, department, and **club logo uploaded to Cloudinary**.
- **Post events** with the full form: name, description, category, max seats, start/end dates, end time, venue and venue link, registration fee, registration form link, registration end date, reward points, key takeaways, a dynamic FAQ list, an event image, and a sample certificate (both uploaded to Cloudinary). A confetti animation plays on success.
- **Edit / delete** your own events. Ownership is checked on the server.
- **Created events** list.
- **Event participants**: choose one of your events to see the enrolled students, then **export the list to Excel (xlsx) or PDF (jsPDF + autotable)**.
- **Organizer calendar** of your own events (upcoming, in progress, or completed), plus the global calendar.
- **Dashboard**: profile info and stats (total, ongoing, upcoming, and completed events), plus a list of ongoing events.
- **Home screen** Dock with Events, Post Event, Created, Calendar and Dashboard.

### Admin features
- Admin signup (API) and signin.
- **Approve or update any event** (`isApproved` flag), through the API.
- **Moderate comments**: delete any comment on any event, through the API.
- **Admin dashboard** with shortcuts to All Events, Approvals and Moderation. Browse all events and view event details.

### UI / UX
- **Dark and light themes** with a sun/moon toggle in the header. The choice is saved, applied before the page paints (no flash), and switched with a circular reveal. See [UI & Design System](#ui--design-system).
- **Floating rounded header** with space around it, and a **floating rounded sidebar** that is role-aware and collapsible (Recoil `sidebarOpenState`). On phones the sidebar slides in from a button in the header.
- **Glass surfaces**: translucent, blurred cards and bars that work in both themes.
- **Home Dock**: a macOS-style tab bar with gentle magnification and a sliding active indicator.
- **Polished calendars**: custom toolbar, today badge, selected-day highlight, themed events and "+N more" pop-up.
- Loading spinners and friendly empty states on every list. Toasts follow the theme.
- Forms built with React Hook Form, with shared input/button styles.

## UI & Design System

### Look and feel
- **Monochrome**: black, white and greys only, with no accent colour.
- **Glass**: translucent surfaces with backdrop blur (`.glass`, `.glass-strong`, `.glass-bar` in `index.css`).
- **Type**: Inter, tight tracking, a soft white-to-grey gradient on headings (`.text-gradient`).
- **Shared controls**: `.field`, `.field-label`, `.field-error`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.chip`.

### Theming (dark / light)

Tailwind's `white`, `black` and `neutral-*` colours resolve to CSS variables. In light mode the variables swap: "white" becomes the ink colour, "black" becomes the paper colour, and the grey scale reverses. Ordinary classes like `text-white`, `bg-white/10` and `text-neutral-400` therefore work in both themes without per-component changes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T["ThemeToggle<br/>(header)"] -->|toggleTheme| H["useTheme hook"]
    H -->|set| A["themeAtom<br/>(Recoil, persisted)"]
    H -->|"html.dark / html.light"| R[":root CSS variables<br/>--c-white · --c-black · --c-n50…950<br/>--glass-* · --page-bg"]

    A -.->|"recoil-persist → localStorage"| S["index.html inline script<br/>applies saved theme before React (no flash)"]
    H -->|"View Transitions API"| V["Circular reveal<br/>(instant fallback)"]
```

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Colour tokens, light palette, glass, calendar styles | `Client/src/index.css` |
| Tailwind colour mapping (`rgb(var(--c-*) / <alpha-value>)`) | `Client/tailwind.config.js` |
| Theme state + toggle logic | `Client/src/components/theme/useTheme.js` |
| Sun/moon button | `Client/src/components/theme/ThemeToggle.jsx` |
| No-flash script | `Client/index.html` |

### Layout
- **Header**: a floating `rounded-full` glass pill, inset from the edges (`top-4`, side gaps). It holds the brand, role badge, theme toggle and auth buttons, and gains a soft shadow once the page scrolls. On phones it also holds the sidebar button.
- **Sidebar**: a floating rounded glass panel (`left-4 top-24 bottom-4`), collapsible on desktop and a slide-in drawer on phones. The active item has a white pill that slides between links.
- **Content**: `pt-24` clears the floating header, and the left margin follows the sidebar width.

### Animation
Animation is deliberately simple: one-time entrances, gentle hovers, and no looping or decorative effects.

| Library | Where |
|---|---|
| **GSAP** | Landing intro (hero copy, then sample cards); one-time scroll fade-ups (features, call to action); Home intro; Dock click press |
| **Framer Motion** | Header and page fade-ins; staggered card grids; small hover lift on cards; sliding active pills (sidebar, sign-up role switch); Dock magnification and active indicator; hero word swap; modal, FAQ and comment transitions; theme icon swap |

- `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` and GSAP `matchMedia` respect the OS "reduce motion" setting.
- Effects that rely on hovering are turned off on touch screens.

### Shared UI components (`Client/src/components/ui/`)
| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Page.jsx` | `Page` (fade-up wrapper), `PageHeader`, `EmptyState`, `Spinner`, stagger variants |
| `EventCard.jsx` | Glass event card used by every event list |
| `Stat.jsx` | `StatTile`, `InfoRow`, `Avatar` for the dashboards |
| `CalendarView.jsx` | Shared calendar: custom toolbar, month grid, day panel, details pop-up (portaled) |
| `Dock.jsx` | macOS Dock–style tab bar for Home: scale-only magnification (no layout shift), always-visible labels, sliding active indicator |

### Key design decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Role-split routers** (`/auth`, `/event`, `/student`, `/organiser`, `/admin`) | Each role has separate responsibilities, so changing one area is unlikely to break another. |
| **Separate collections per role** (Student / Organizer / Admin) | Each role has different profile fields. Access is decided by which collection the JWT's `userId` belongs to. |
| **Direct browser → Cloudinary uploads** | The backend never handles binary files. It only stores the returned URLs, which keeps the API lightweight. |
| **Embedded sub-documents in Event** (comments, FAQs, enrolledStudents) | These are always read together with the event, so one read returns the whole event page. |
| **Two-sided enrollment** (`Event.enrolledStudents` and `Student.eventsEnrolled`) | Lookups are fast both ways: participants per event, and events per student. |
| **TTL-indexed token collections** | Verification links expire after 1 hour, and MongoDB deletes them without any cron job. |
| **Client-side exports** | Excel and PDF files are generated in the browser, so no export service is needed. |

    A->>AD: PUT /admin/event/comment/:eventId/:commentId
    AD->>AD: verifyUser → validAdmin
    AD->>DB: splice comment (any owner)
```

#### 7. Page refresh and logout (session on the client)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as User
    participant B as Browser
    participant LS as localStorage
    participant R as Recoil (userAtom)
    participant H as Header.jsx

    U->>B: Refresh any page
    B->>LS: recoil-persist reads saved userAtom
    LS-->>R: {username, role, isLoggedIn: true, ...}
    Note over R: UI renders as logged in. API calls reuse localStorage.token
    alt token expired (organizer, after 1h)
        B-->>U: API returns 401 "Invalid or expired token" → sign in again
    end
    U->>H: Click "Log Out"
    H->>R: resetUser() → default (isLoggedIn: false)
    H->>LS: removeItem('token')
    H->>B: navigate('/')
```

#### 8. Theme toggle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as User
    participant T as ThemeToggle
    participant H as useTheme
    participant A as themeAtom (persisted)
    participant D as document (html)

    U->>T: Click sun/moon
    T->>H: toggleTheme()
    alt View Transitions API available
        H->>D: startViewTransition → circular reveal
    end
    H->>A: set 'light' | 'dark'
    H->>D: html.classList = light | dark
    Note over D: CSS variables swap → every Tailwind colour updates
    Note over U,D: Next load: inline script in index.html applies the saved theme before React paints
```

### Auth and verification state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Registered: POST signUp
    Registered --> PendingVerification: token saved + email sent
    PendingVerification --> Verified: valid link clicked (< 1h)
    PendingVerification --> TokenExpired: 1h TTL elapses
    TokenExpired --> PendingVerification: sign-in attempt re-issues token
    PendingVerification --> PendingVerification: sign-in attempt (blocked)
    Verified --> Authenticated: sign-in → JWT issued
    Authenticated --> Verified: logout (token removed)
    Authenticated --> Verified: JWT expired (organizer 1h)
```

### Event lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Organizer submits form
    Draft --> Pending: saved (isApproved=false)
    Pending --> Approved: Admin PUT isApproved=true
    Pending --> Pending: Organizer edits
    Approved --> RegistrationOpen: now < registrationEndDate
    RegistrationOpen --> RegistrationClosed: registrationEndDate passed / maxLimit reached
    RegistrationClosed --> Ongoing: startDate
    Ongoing --> Completed: endDate
    Pending --> Deleted: Organizer deletes
    Approved --> Deleted: Organizer deletes
    Completed --> [*]
    Deleted --> [*]

## Validation Rules

Enforced on the server with Zod:

- **Username**: 3–30 characters.
- **Password**: at least 8 characters, with at least one letter, at least one digit (1–9), and an `@` that is not the first character.
- **Email**: valid email format.
- **Student**: `phoneNumber` and `year` must be numbers.
- **Organizer**: `phoneNumber` is coerced to a number; `clubName`, `position`, and `logo` are required.
- **Event** (schema defined in `validEventData`, **not yet attached** to `POST /event/app/v1/create`): name, description, category, venue, venueAddress, keyTakeAways, registrationForm, and endTime are strings; maxLimit, registrationFee, and rewardPoints are numbers; dates are coerced; each FAQ needs a non-empty question and answer.
- **Client side**: React Hook Form validates the same fields in the forms before sending.

Uniqueness is enforced by MongoDB indexes: username, email, and phone number per role, club name, and event name.

## How to Add a Feature

### A. New API endpoint
1. Pick the router in `Server/apis/` that owns the resource (events → `Event.js`, student profile → `User.js`, ...).
2. Add the handler with the same shape as the others:
   ```js
   eventApp.get('/app/v1/events/:eventId/summary', verifyUser, async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const event = await Events.findById(req.params.eventId);
       if (!event) return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Event not found' });
       res.status(200).json({ message: 'ok', payload: { name: event.eventName, enrolled: event.enrolled } });
     } catch (e) {
       console.error(e);
       res.status(500).json({ message: 'Something went wrong' });
     }
   });
   ```
3. Add `validPerson` (organizer only) or `validAdmin` after `verifyUser` if the route is role-restricted. Add a Zod validator for request bodies.
4. If you add a field, update the Mongoose schema in `Server/models/`.
5. Responses always look like `{ message, payload }`. Keep that so the client code stays uniform.
6. Add a row to the [API Reference](#api-reference).

### B. New page
1. Create the component in `components/students/`, `components/organizer/` or `components/common/`.
2. Wrap it in the shared UI kit so it matches the rest of the app:
   ```jsx
   import { Page, PageHeader, Spinner, EmptyState } from '../ui/Page';

   function MyPage() {
     return (
       <Page>
         <PageHeader title="My Page" subtitle="One line about it" />
         {/* loading ? <Spinner/> : items.length ? <grid/> : <EmptyState/> */}
       </Page>
     );
   }
   ```
3. Call the API with `` `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/...` `` and `headers: { Authorization: localStorage.getItem('token') }`.
4. Register the route in `Client/src/main.jsx` under the right role (`student-profile/:emailId`, ...).
5. Optionally add a sidebar link (`common/Sidebar.jsx`, the `links` array) and/or a Home Dock tab (`common/Home.jsx`, the `tabs` array: `{ id, label, icon, roles }` plus a render line).

### C. Styling rules
- Use `text-white`, `bg-white/10`, `text-neutral-400`, `border-white/10`, ... They flip automatically in light mode. Avoid raw hex colours and `gray-*` classes; they don't follow the theme.
- Reuse `.glass`, `.field`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.chip` from `index.css`.
- Keep animation simple: one-time entrances and small hovers (see [Animation](#animation)).

## Development Workflow & Checks

### Git
- Pull before you start: `git pull`.
- Work on a branch: `git checkout -b feature/short-name`, then open a pull request into `main`.
- **Resolve merge conflicts file by file.** Never "accept all theirs/ours" blindly. A bad conflict resolution once broke the build: `Events.jsx` got an old opening tag with a new closing tag, `Footer.jsx` lost its imports, and the header and layout reverted (see `plan.md`, Phase 10).
- Never commit `.env`, `node_modules`, or `dist`.

### Checks before you push (from `Client/`)
| Check | Command | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Lint (uses the project config) | `npx eslint src` | Undefined variables, missing imports, unused code, hook mistakes. The project is at **0 errors**: keep it there (the 5 `react-refresh` warnings are harmless) |
| Production build | `npm run build` | JSX syntax errors, bad imports |
| Quick syntax check of one file | `npx esbuild src/components/common/Events.jsx --loader:.js=jsx` | Mismatched tags |

> Run ESLint with the project config (plain `npx eslint src`). With `--no-config-lookup` it silently skips `.jsx` files and reports nothing.

Then test in the browser: sign up, verify, sign in, and the page you changed, in **both themes** and at **phone width**.

### Logging changes
Add a short entry to `plan.md` for every change: what, which files, how it was checked.

## Deployment

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Client | Vercel (`Client/vercel.json` rewrites every path to `/` so React Router handles deep links) | Set `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` in the Vercel project settings. Build command `npm run build`, output `dist` |
| Server | Render (`event-connect-backend-slbb.onrender.com`) or any Node 18+ host | Root directory `Server`, build `npm install`, start `npm start`. Set every `Server/.env` key in the dashboard. Set `BASE_URL` to the deployed client URL so verification links work. **Free Render blocks SMTP**: set `BREVO_API_KEY` + `MAIL_FROM` |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas | Allow the server's IP in Network Access |

After deploying the server, update `VITE_API_URL` on Vercel and redeploy the client. Vite bakes env values in at build time.

**Is the new server code live?** Send an invalid signup: `curl -X POST <server>/auth/student/signUp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"x"}'`. Current code answers `Invalid username: …`; old code answers just `Invalid data`. Also check the Render logs for `Mailer ready: …`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Network calls go to `undefined/event/...` | `Client/.env` missing `VITE_API_URL`, or Vite not restarted | Add it, restart `npm run dev` |
| **CORS error** on sign in/up | The client points at a port where something else is running (port 3000 is often Docker/WSL) | Make sure `VITE_API_URL` points at the Express port (4000) and the server is running |
| No verification email | Wrong `USER`/`PASS`, or `PASS` isn't an App Password; mail in spam | At startup the server prints `Mailer ready: ...` or `Mailer NOT ready — ...` with the reason. Fix `.env`, restart, then sign in to get a new link |
| Verification link says "invalid link" | Token older than 1 hour (deleted by TTL) or already used | Sign in again: a new link is emailed |
| Sign in says "Please verify your email first" | Account not verified yet | A new link is emailed on every such sign-in attempt. Click it |
| Sign up returns **500** on the deployed site | Render is still running old code (old code returns 500 for a duplicate email/username/phone) | Redeploy the latest commit on Render (Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit), then use the check under [Deployment](#deployment) |
| Deployed: signup works but no email arrives | Render's free plan blocks SMTP; logs show `Mailer NOT ready — … timeout` | Set `BREVO_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` in Render → Environment |
| Sign up says "An account with this email already exists" | You registered earlier (maybe the email failed) | Sign in instead: it re-sends the verification link |
| Organizer suddenly gets 401 | Organizer JWT expires after 1 hour | Log out and sign in |
| Images don't upload | `VITE_CLOUDINARY_*` missing, or the preset is "Signed" | Set both variables; make the preset Unsigned |
| `database is successfully connected` never prints | Wrong `DB_URL`, or Atlas IP not allowed | Check the string and Atlas Network Access |
| Refreshing a deep link on Vercel gives 404 | Missing SPA rewrite | Keep `Client/vercel.json` |
| Content hidden under the header, or the sidebar overlaps | `RootLayout.jsx` changed | Content needs `pt-24` and `md:ml-64` / `md:ml-24` |
| `X is not defined` in the browser console | Missing import (often after a merge) | `npx eslint src` points to the line |

## Known Issues & Limitations

- **Event validation**: `validEventData` (Zod) exists in `Event.js` but isn't attached to the create route.
- **Admin UI**: the admin dashboard shows shortcut cards, and `ManageEvents` is a "coming soon" page. Event approval and comment moderation are available only through the API.
- **Theme transition**: the circular reveal needs the View Transitions API (Chrome/Edge). Other browsers switch themes instantly.
- **Approval is not enforced**: events are listed whether or not `isApproved` is set.
- **Student / admin JWTs never expire**. Only organizer tokens have `expiresIn: 1h`.
- Enrollment does not check `maxLimit` or `registrationEndDate` on the server.
- No pagination, search, rate limiting, caching, or automated tests yet.
- `Client/src/routes.jsx` and `LandingPageLayout.jsx` are unused. The live routes are in `main.jsx`.
- The URL param is named `:emailId` but holds the username.

---

## Future Improvements

- Admin UI for approvals, moderation, and analytics (the dashboard shortcuts are already in place).
- Show only approved events to students, and enforce seat and deadline limits on the server.
- Central Axios instance with base URL and interceptors (auth header, 401 → logout).
- Refresh tokens and consistent JWT expiry across roles.
- Pagination, search, and category filters for events.
- Email notifications for enrollment confirmations and event reminders.
- Certificates generated automatically after event completion.
- Leaderboard based on reward points.
- Rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`), Helmet, and a stricter CORS origin.
- Unit and integration tests (Jest + Supertest), plus CI.
- Docker Compose for one-command local setup.

## Learning Path for New Contributors

Read the code in this order. Each step builds on the previous one.

| Day | Read | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | This README (Part A), then `plan.md` | Know what the app does and why it looks the way it does |
| 1 | `Server/server.js` → `middlewares/verifyUser.js` → `models/*.js` | Understand the API bootstrap, auth, and data shape |
| 2 | `Server/apis/Auth.js` | Signup, email verification, sign-in, JWT |
| 2 | `Server/apis/Event.js` | Event CRUD, enrollment, comments, role guard |
| 3 | `Client/src/main.jsx` → `RootLayout.jsx` → `UserAtom.js` | Routing, layout, session state |
| 3 | `common/SignIn.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`, `VerifyPage.jsx` | The client side of auth, Cloudinary logo upload |
| 4 | `common/Home.jsx` → `ui/Dock.jsx` → `common/Events.jsx` → `ui/EventCard.jsx` | How pages are composed from the shared UI kit |
| 4 | `common/EventsById.jsx` | The biggest page: details, enroll, comments, edit/delete |
| 5 | `organizer/PostEvent.jsx`, `EventParticipants.jsx` | Forms with uploads, Excel/PDF export |
| 5 | `index.css`, `tailwind.config.js`, `theme/useTheme.js` | Theming with CSS variables |

### Starter tasks (good first issues)
1. Attach `validEventData` to `POST /event/app/v1/create` (check the client sends numbers, not strings).
2. Check `maxLimit` and `registrationEndDate` on the server when enrolling.
3. Check that an organizer owns the event in `GET /event/students/enroll/:eventId`.
4. Create a shared Axios instance (`baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`, auth header interceptor).
